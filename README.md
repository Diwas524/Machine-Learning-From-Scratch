Artificial intelligence can be interpreted as adding human intelligence in a machine. The beginning of modern AI started when the term “Artificial Intelligence” was coined in 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover. The field has come a very long way in the past decade. The 10s were the hottest AI summer with tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft repeatedly touting AI’s abilities.
