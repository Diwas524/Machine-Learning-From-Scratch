# Logitic Regression From Scratch

Welcome to new machine learning from scratch tutorial. In today’s tutorial, we are going to cover Logistic Regression from scratch. First of all, we would like to thank Bishal Boss who helped us to make this content possible. Now before begin, we assume you are already familiar with some of the topics:

    1. Classification and Regression in Machine Learning.
    2. What is a Binary Classification ?
    3. Basic Geometry of Line, Plane, and Hyper-Plane in 2D, 3D, and n-D space respectively.
    4. What is Maxima & Minima?
    5. Loss Function.

# WHAT IS LOGISTIC REGRESSION ?

In simple Terms, Logistic Regression is a Classification technique, which is best used for Binary Classification Problems. Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables.

Let’s say, we have a Binary Classification problem, which has only 2 classes true or false. Imagine we want to detect whether a credit card transaction is genuine or fraudulent.

    +1 = Genuine
    -1 = Fraudulent

Firstly, let’s try to plot our data points in a 2D space, considering we can visualize 2D in a better way here.
